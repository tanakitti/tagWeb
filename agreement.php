                <br>Nowadays, there are many algorithms that are developed from the existing algorithms. That would be one of the problem
                that a researcher would find. They do not know that which algorithm is the algorithm that was extended. This research
                is created to solve that problem. This research is a part of the senior project of the students from the faculty of
                Information Communication and Technology(ICT).<br>
